Code for FrankenBadge, A Nixie Tube Clock You Can Wear || DEFCON27 || INDIE BADGE #BADGELIFE


It's a badge.
It's a Nixie Tube clock.
It's a monster.
It's... FrankenBADGE!!!

A Frankenstein's Monster-shaped, electronic badge you can wear to your favourite con.

Features include, but are not limited to:

- 4x IN-12A/B Nixie Tubes! These bad-boys are probably older than you and are stolen from some old Ukrainian Bunker / Missile Silo
- 1x K155ID1 Nixie Tube Driver! I saved money by multiplexing the tubers! 
- 1x ATMEGA32U4 Microcontroller! It's the same one from the Arduino Leonardo, meaning you can program it using the USB-port! How handy is that eh?!
- 1x DS3231, Real-time clock, to keep your time when you lose power and shit!
- A fancy lanyard!
- 9V battery holder (9v **NOT** included)
- DC-jack, for powering at home, the office, your toilet, the portable toilet you have at work, any place really that has electricity... (9-36v, center positive, 5mm jack)
- USB-mini port for reprogramming (this does not power the badge!)

PLEASE NOTE:
FOR KIT VERSIONS, a hot-air rework station and / or reflow oven are HIGHLY recommended. The smallest parts are 0402, which can be soldered by hand, but I wouldn't recommend it... unless you enjoy punishing yourself ;-)
